# Title of the Project : AUGUSTUS
# Description
During this covid-19 pandemic situation, one of the major issues is awareness regarding the disease its symptoms and what steps should one follow if he/she gets affected by this deadly virus or they came in contact with some positive person. There are still a lot of people who are unable to verify if they are covid positive or not, by exposure to different fake social media news or any other similar fever symptoms they get panicked, so it is very much necessary to prevent this pandemic from its very groud level. Therefore we have 
come up with the idea of "AUGUSTUS", to help "Covid Home Management of Mild and Moderate Infections".AUGUSTUS is a web based application which basically few details from the user which are 
mostly the symptoms of covid-19 which are.
* Cough
* Fever
* Sore Throat
* Shortness of breath
* Headache
* If the user is in contact with any other person

We have created a Machine Learning model which will classify the users into three different categories 
* Covid Positive
* Covid Negative
* Others (basically the symptoms of mild fever or cold)

After predicting the user health data the web app will simply provide the user with certain guidelines that he/she should follow whether they have tested positive or negative.
The main motto of this web app is to spread the awareness of the guidelines to be followed by the users and every person can get themselves verified here for free if they're scared of anything 
and get themselves cured.
